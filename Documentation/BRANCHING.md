# Branching Guide

## Stable Branch
This branch is designed for stability. It won't receive frequent updates, but it's expected to have fewer bugs and undergo thorough testing.

## Pre-release Branch
The pre-release branch is less stable than the stable branch but more stable than the development branch. Updates are less frequent. You may encounter some bugs, and testing may or may not be comprehensive. Consider using this branch if you want to test upcoming features before they reach the stable branch.

## Development Branch
The development branch is frequently updated to incorporate new features and changes. However, it's less stable and may contain critical bugs. Testing may or may not be thorough. Use this branch if you want to stay on the bleeding edge of development but be prepared for some instability.
